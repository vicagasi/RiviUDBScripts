## Tagging Scripts

### Stepwise Incrementing Tagger
Increments each selected line every x steps, where x is the Step Value you set. Goes in ascending order of lindef numbers.
* Starting Tag - The number the incrementing starts at. Can't be zero or less.
* Step Value - How many 'steps' the program takes before incrementing the number
* Additive Tagging - Adds the tags to the lines instead of replacing then. UDMF only.

### Sector Tags to Linedef Tags
Replaces the tags of each selected sector's linedefs with the sector's tags.

## Help
